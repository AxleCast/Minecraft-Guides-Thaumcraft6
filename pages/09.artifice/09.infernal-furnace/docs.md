In order to complete this section you will need to go into the Nether. The Infernal Furnace is another multiblock structure you need to use Salis Mundus on. This fuel free furnace will smelt anything you throw into the top of it and it will spit out any nuggets and ingots from the front. You can place a chest in the hole to catch the items, and a brain in a jar nearby to catch the experience.
