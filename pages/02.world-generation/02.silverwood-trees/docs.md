Silverwood trees grow throughout the world and can be easily recognized by their distinct light blue leaves and white logs. These trees normally have shimmerleaf growing by their roots. 

When chopping down these trees you will get silverwood saplings (rare drop). The silverwood  logs can be harvested and converted into silverwood planks. Silverwood trees may also drop 0-4 quicksilvers when harvested.
