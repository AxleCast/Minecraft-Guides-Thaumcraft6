Flux is generated when releasing Essentia into the world without filtering it. Flux is sort of a bad aura around a chunk. Too much flux can cause less vis to generate in the area and can also lead to rifts. Rifts will destroy any blocks that come in contact with them. Over time these rifts will decrease the amount of flux in a chunk. After a while these rifts will leave behind a giant taint seed. These giant taint seeds spread and maintain Taint. This is almost the only way to obtain Vitium, which is required for Essentia Tubes (even though you can get vitium from mycelium, nether wart and vishrooms).

Flux rifts generate on the highest block in the corrupted chunk.
