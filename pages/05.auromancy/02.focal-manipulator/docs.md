The Focal Manipulator allows you to craft a Focus that you can use with your Casterâ€™s Gauntlet. If you put it in your offhand, you will see icons on the top left of your screen. The big circle is the Focus you currently have equipped (none at the moment), and the bar is how much Vis is in the area (each chunk has a different amount of Vis).
