Casting spells is fun, but you can spice things up a little. No need to get up close and personal when you can fire projectiles at mobs.

This research will require you to scan something with Motus. This can be done by scanning a trap door. After doing some more research, you can complete the quest.

The next part to this requires you to be hit by 3 different types of projectile:

* Normal Projectile
	* Place an arrow in a dispenser and fire it at yourself (or let a Skeleton shoot you)
* Fiery Projectile
	* Place a firecharge in a dispenser and fire it at yourself (or let a Blaze shoot you).
* Sticky Projectile
	* Find a llama, hit it and let it spit at you. They spawn in Savannah and Mountain biomes.
