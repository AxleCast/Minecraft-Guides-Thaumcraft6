There is a little research to be done here, so either scan all the things you have made up until now, or visit the Research Table. You need four Phials of Essentia in your inventory. Break down items in the Furnace and then collect the Essentia.The easiest way to get these is as follows:

* Phial of Vitium
	* Nether Wart
* Phial of Vinculum
	* Oak door or Amber
* Phial of Alienis
	* Ender pearl 
* Phial of Alkimia
	* Gunpowder, blaze powder, brewing stand or magma cream

You may need more than one of the above items, and you will need to empty out your Alembics with Jars. 

The last Essentia you will need is Vitium. This is very hard to come by and there is no easy way to get it.  One option is to collect Mycelium from a Mushroom Island. Finding a mushroom island can be easy with mods like [Nature’s Compass](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/natures-compass), but if you do not have such a mod, finding a mushroom island is nearly impossible. In that case, your best bet is to go **FAR AWAY** from your base/house and cause a whole bunch of taint. 

>>>>PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING FAR AWAY FROM YOUR HOME

Or you could just go to the nether and get nether wart but that’s just the easy way of doing things.

To cause taint, bring a Crucible, Water, Nitor and five droppers. Set up your Crucible. Once the water is bubbling, throw the droppers into the Crucible and then sneak-right-click it. This will release a whole bunch of flux into the area. Alternatively, you can dump a few stacks of dirt or cobblestone if you have extra lying around.

You will soon notice strange things happening, such as Rifts in the world that will damage you if you walk into them and will also destroy items. This might not happen straight away so be patient but you will get a message on screen saying that there is too much flux in the area. The rift will also spawn Wisps:

Slowly but surely, a Taint Seed will spawn and it will start to spread Taint. You want this thing to taint a bit of land around it, and then you want to kill it from a distance. It has a bunch of health and it will poison you if you get too close. It will also taint mobs:

You are looking for tainted blocks. Once the Seed has tainted a little bit of the area (leave it for around 2-3 minutes) kill it and then collect as many tainted soil blocks as possible. You also want to scan everything in the area too:

You will pick up a few Vitium Crystals as well. No matter what tool you use to mine up taint, it will take a long time. Once you have a few blocks of tainted soil, return home and use that to make Phials of Vitium. Store as much Vitium as possible because it’s hard to come by.

>>> Using an Exchange Focus to switch tainted blocks with dirt is a much faster way of collecting taint than mining it.

Once you have all four of these Phials in your inventory, complete this section. This will unlock a whole load of Essentia Tubes:
