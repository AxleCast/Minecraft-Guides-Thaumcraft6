Using pipes to try to get your Essentia to the right place is a hassle, and mastering them correctly can be a nightmare. Thankfully, there is an easier way to move Essentia from one place to another without needing to build a complex piping system.

In order to unlock Advanced Essentia Transport, you will need to quickly dive into the Arcane Infusion Tab (on the left when you open your Thaumonomicon).

Clicking on Basic Infusion will unlock this for you. There is no need to do any research yet.
