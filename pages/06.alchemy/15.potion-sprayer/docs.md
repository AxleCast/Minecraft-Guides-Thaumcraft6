Doing some further research will allow you to unlock the Potion Sprayer. This little machine will allow you to craft potions from Essentia. This machine will make potions out of Essentia and store them in the machine. When a redstone signal is applied, the potion will be splashed out in a 3x3 area in front of the machine. This can be useful in a mob trap, or as an area to buff yourself.

First, you will need to add a potion to the Sprayer. This will then tell you what Essentia is needed to create the potion. Attaching an Emptying Essentia Transfuser to the Sprayer will then automatically pull out the needed essentia from nearby Jars.
