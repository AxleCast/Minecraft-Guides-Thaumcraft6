To progress in “Delving into the Eldritch”, you’ll need to obtain something native to the void, void seeds. You need the Causality Collapser which has the “Flux Rifts” and “Flux” research as prerequisites, found on the “Fundamentals” tab. 

The Causality Collapser is a device that when thrown (as you would a snowball) into a rift, closes the rift. The Thaumonomicon recommends that you first stabilize the rift.
